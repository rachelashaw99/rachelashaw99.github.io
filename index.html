		<h1>BritWay</h1>

		<p>Speedway is one of many variations of motorsports available in Britain. The sport consists of riders competing either individually or as part of a 7-member team against other riders or teams from across Britain. Each singular race has four riders racing against each other on motorbikes, and the first of the riders to complete four full cycles of the race circuit is the winner of the race.</p>
		<p>Throughout the speedway season, each team competes against each other in a minimum of two meetings - one at each of the teams' home track. From these meetings, the individual riders' scores are combined over 15 races - or 'heats' - to determine the winning team. The winning team then gains league points and moves up the league table, while the losing team remain in the same position. Once every team has competed against each other twice, the league table is reviewed and the championship stage begins, with the top teams from the season competing against each other again to determine who is the overall winning team of the season.</p>
		<p>The speedway clubs competing in the premier league 2019 are:</p>
